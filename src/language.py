    When the language setting is changed after game has been booted up,
    you should reimport every entities from the factory to update their names/desc into translated ones.

    NOTE:
        It is important that you should seperate ~_factories.py files and class declaration files.
        For example, If reload the ais.py file which is NOT a factory type file but a class declaration file,
        you'll have a pickle/shelve related error since the ai classes are redeclared and the pickle lib will get confused.
        So it is extremely important to use 'interpret()' function only in the instance scope, NOT in the class declaration scope.
        For the same reason, you should NEVER have a class declaration inside of ~_factories.py file since they will cause an error
        when reimported.

        e.g.
        < Best thing to do >
        rabbit = Actor( ... , name = interpret("토끼", "rabbit"), ... )

        < Will not work and will cause an error >
        RabbitActor( ... )
            def __init__( ... , name = interpret("토끼", "rabbit"), ... ):
                self.name = name
                ...

        < Will work but is not recommended >
        RabbitActor( ... )
            def __init__( ... ):
                self.name = interpret("토끼", "rabbit")
                ...
