                A color representation of this biome.
                Can be used in many different visual aspects.
                NOTE: It is highly recommended to use low contrast, dark tone colors since it is mainly used for background coloring.
            biome_desc:
                Recommended not to write more than 5 lines.
                Each lines should contain less than 110 characters. (Including blanks)
            respawn_ratio:
                This parameter is connected to the maximum number of monsters that can be spawned by the gamemap's monster regeneration.
                The value itself means the maximum ratio of the monster number compared to the original monster number when the gamemap was first generated.
                ex. respawn_ratio = 0.5, starting monster number = 100
                > If more than 50 monster die or leaves the game map, monster regeneration begins.
                > Which means, unless more than 50 monsters die, the gamemap will not regenerate any monster.
            respawn_time:
                Time that takes for a single loop of monster regeneration. (In-game turn)
            generate_descending_stair:
                Whether to randomize descending stair or not.
                e.g. you can set this to False when generating last level (maximum depth)
            room_spacing:
                minimum X axis distance between each room.
                should always have value over 0. (default 1)
                higher the value gets, the biome gets less compact.
                NOTE: Use room_x_spacing or room_y_spacing instead.
            tileset:
                tileset of this biome.
                The arguments must be passed by using the "tileset() function" above.
            terrain:
                Possible terrains for this gamemap/biome.
                key - terrain id (string)
                value - weight (integer)
            additional_terrain:
                If you want to modify specific terrain's rarity, or add specific terrain to the biome, use this value.
                You can modify self.terrain directly is there's a lot of changes to be made from default terrain list.
            remove_all_terrain_of_type:
                iterate through tileset, and remove all tileset that satisfies the given condition.
                e.g.
                remove_all_terrain_of_type = ("has_door", "gen_traps")
                -> Will set rarity of terrains that has door OR generate traps to 0
            monster_difficulty:
                Dictionary. Key - difficulty, value - weight
                If not None, every monster generated in this biome will be clamped into given difficulty range.
                e.g. {5: 3, 6: 1}

                NOTE: If terrain in the biome has specifed monster generation dictionary(monster_to_spawn),
                    it will ignore this limit range.
                NOTE: This value DO AFFECT respawning monsters.
                NOTE: If you set this value to something weird, for example{999: 1}, the game has potential danger of stucking in infinite loop which is extremely bad.
                We do check if every key is valid beforehand, still it is highly recommended to follow the following rules:
                    1) dictionary should have more than 1 item.
                    2) you should check each keys in the dictionary is valid.
